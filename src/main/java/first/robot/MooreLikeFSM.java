/**
 * Demonstration of a Moore-Like FSM example based on the StateMachine class model in WPILib
 * Command-Based V3.
 * 
 * This FSM example sequentially displays eight red LEDs first to last then back last to first
 *   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 ...
 * 
 * To demonstrate the trigger for "whenComplete" a cycle counter state is added. It contributes
 * nothing to the light bar and is just to show the use of "whenComplete". The cycle count is
 * displayed in NT viewer.
 * 
 * The triggers are a user specified clock period distributed among 14 bins for 14 triggers needed
 * for this example of the Knight Rider Kitt Scanner.
 * 
 * The scanner runs Disabled and in the example usage in Robot it is started immediately.
 * 
 * This example is a bit of a cheat - that is there are a few things wrong with it not being a
 * perfect FSM. There are several complex states but they are all identical except for a sequence
 * number - light number. That allows severe compression of code.  Normally each state would have its
 * own Functional Command combining the Entry, Exit, and Steady-state Runnables for that state.
 * 
 * There 8 states of the lights and each of those states has 2 possible exit transitions for counting
 * up or counting down with the 14 clocked triggers. An additional state to count cycles is defined
 * to show an example of the transition made if a state completes normally (internal event) and was
 * not interrupted by an external event. [The FSM could have been organized as 14 states with one
 * clocked triggered.]
 * 
 * This FSM does not demonstrate a STOP State except by cancelling the command.
